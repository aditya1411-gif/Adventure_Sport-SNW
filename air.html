            <h3>Skydiving</h3>
            <p>It involves jumping off from great heights from an aircraft or a hot air balloon with deploying the parachute initially for some time to get the sense of thin air, air brushing off the face. The divers release the parachute only after some predetermined height.</p>

            <h3>Parachuting</h3>
            <p>It is very similar to the free fall, except the diver unfurls the parachute immediately after jumping off. It is much safer the sky diving and hence is more open to the common adventurers.</p>

            <h3>Hand-Gliding</h3>
            <p>It makes use of semi-rigid wing like structures, called gliders, which helps to glide (or fly) in the air and the maneuverability is achieved by shifting the weight to get the directional control. </p>

            <h3>Bungee-Jumping</h3>
            <p>The diver jumps off from a bridge or any landscape offering good elevation of a few hundred feet. The diver is tied to a bungee cord, a high elasticity nylon fiber chord, to absorb the shock at the end of the jump. This is the most popular adventure sport in the country. </p>

            <h3>Paragliding</h3>
            <p>A paraglide is a non-motorized, foot-launched inflatable wing. Made of rip stop nylon or high stress polyester fabric. The pilot sits in a sitting position strapped to a harness. The harness is further attached to the Paraglide by thin but string Kevlar lines. The pilot can remain air borne for hours is winds are favorable, travel long distances and can attain an altitude of more than 10,000 feet’s. Pilot wears a helmet and a reserve parachute for safety and a variometer to gauge the ascent or descent of the glider.</p>
